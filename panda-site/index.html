        General Panda Information
    </h3>
    <p>
        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear (or
        simply the panda), is a bear[6] native to South Central China.[1] It is characterised by its bold
        black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red
        panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with
        bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat
        other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may
        receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[8][9]

    <h3>Classification</h3>
    <p>
        For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares
        characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[19] However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true
        bear, part of the family Ursidae.[6][20] These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the
        common ancestor of the Ursidae;[21] it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other
        extant bear species.[22][21] The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.[23]
